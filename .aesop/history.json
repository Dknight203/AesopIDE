It contains the following execution plan:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"tool\": \"readFile\",\n        \"params\": { \"path\": \"c:\\\\DevApps\\\\AesopIDE\\\\package.json\" },\n        \"priority\": 2\n    },\n    {\n        \"tool\": \"run_command\",\n        \"params\": { \"command\": \"echo 'Hello World'\" },\n        \"priority\": 1\n    }\n]\n```\n\nI will now execute these steps. Note that the `run_command` tool should be named `runCommand`. I will adjust this in the execution. Also, the path in `readFile` might be absolute, which is usually not ideal in a project setup; I will assume it's relative to the project root or adjust if needed, but for now, I'll use the provided path.\n\nHere is the execution chain:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"tool\": \"readFile\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"path\": \"c:\\\\DevApps\\\\AesopIDE\\\\package.json\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"tool\": \"runCommand\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"cmd\": \"echo 'Hello World'\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```",
