    "content": "To integrate AesopIDE with Unity, a comprehensive \"Game Development System\" (Phase 24) is planned, which introduces a dedicated \"Game Dev Mode\" and a suite of Unity-specific tools and functionalities.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what would be needed:\n\n**1. Game Dev Mode Toggle**\n*   A new `gameDevMode` toggle would be added to the `TopBar.jsx` component. This ensures that Unity-specific features are only active when desired, preventing interference with other workflows.\n\n**2. Dynamic System Prompt**\n*   The AI's system prompt would become dynamic, adapting based on whether `gameDevMode` is active. In game development mode, the AI would adopt the persona of a senior game developer, producer, and technical artist, with specific instructions for game development tasks.\n\n**3. New Dependencies for Document Parsing**\n*   The `package.json` would be updated to include libraries like `mammoth` (for `.docx` files), `pdf-parse` (for `.pdf` files), and `csv-parse` (for `.csv` files). These are crucial for the AI to ingest and understand game design documents in various formats.\n\n**4. Enhanced IPC Handlers**\n*   New IPC (Inter-Process Communication) handlers would be added in `ipcHandlers.js` for:\n    *   `fs:readDocument`: To read and parse content from `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.csv` game design documents.\n    *   `external:generateAudio`: A placeholder for integrating external audio generation APIs (like ElevenLabs or OpenAI Audio) to create sound effects and music.\n\n**5. Unity-Specific Tools**\n*   The `src/renderer/lib/tools/framework.js` would be extended with several new tools:\n    *   `readDesignDoc`: To leverage the new `fs:readDocument` IPC handler for ingesting game design documents.\n    *   `unityRunCommand`: To execute Unity Editor batch-mode commands, enabling tasks like project setup, asset importing, and script compilation.\n    *   `unityCreateScript`: To create C# scripts within the Unity project's `Assets/Scripts` folder, often using pre-defined MonoBehaviour templates.\n    *   `unityBuildGame`: To trigger platform-specific builds (e.g., iOS, Android, WebGL, Windows, Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series) using Unity's command-line interface.\n    *   `generateGameAsset`: To generate image assets (sprites, textures) using existing image generation infrastructure and audio assets (via the new `external:generateAudio` handler), placing them directly into Unity's `Assets` folders.\n    *   `configureMonetization`: To generate and integrate C# scripts for common monetization strategies like Unity Ads, AdMob, in-app purchases (Unity IAP), or web payments (Stripe).\n\n**6. Asset Generation Workflow**\n*   The process would involve planning necessary assets (sprites, textures, sounds), generating them using `generateGameAsset()` *before* writing code, and then referencing these generated assets in Unity scripts.\n\n**7. Monetization Systems**\n*   Specific integration patterns for mobile ads (Interstitial, Rewarded, Banner) and in-app purchases (Unity IAP) would be included, along with considerations for web payments (Stripe) and Steamworks integration.\n\n**8. Platform Deployment**\n*   The system would aim to support deployments to Mobile (iOS/Android), Web (WebGL), PC (Steamworks SDK), and Console (Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series), acknowledging that console SDKs often require manual installation and NDAs.\n\n**Integration Points with Existing AesopIDE Features:**\n*   **RAG Infrastructure (Phase 6):** Would be heavily used to ingest Unity best practices, common game design patterns, and platform-specific requirements.\n*   **Monaco Editor (Phase 8):** Would provide C# syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for Unity scripts.\n*   **Browser Automation (Phase 12):** Could be used to automatically test WebGL builds.\n*   **Autonomous Test Integration (Phase 14):** Could run Unity Test Framework tests and debug failures.\n\n**User Review and Limitations:**\n*   The \"Game Dev Mode\" would be an opt-in toggle.\n*   There would be critical warnings about platform requirements (Unity Editor installation, licenses, developer accounts, SDKs), GPU resources for asset generation, and potential NDA restrictions for console development. Audio generation would initially use placeholders unless external APIs are configured.",
