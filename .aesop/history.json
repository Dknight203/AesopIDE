Create AgentManager.jsx panel\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Create the foundational React component for the Agent Manager panel.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   Create a new functional React component file `AgentManager.jsx` in `src/renderer/components/`.\\n    *   Include a basic `div` structure that will eventually hold the step execution display, controls, and status.\\n    *   Import React and define a default functional component.\\n*   **Tools:** `writeFile`\\n\\n## 2. Create agentmanager.css styles\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Provide initial styling for the `AgentManager` panel.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   Create a new CSS file `agentmanager.css` in `src/renderer/styles/`.\\n    *   Add basic styles for the main container and placeholder elements within the `AgentManager` component to ensure it's visually distinct when rendered.\\n*   **Tools:** `writeFile`\\n\\n## 3. Add panel state to App.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Integrate the `AgentManager` panel into the main application, controlled by its own state.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/App.jsx`.\\n    *   Add a new state variable, e.g., `showAgentManager`, using the `useState` hook to manage the visibility of the panel.\\n    *   Conditionally render the `AgentManager` component within `App.jsx` based on the `showAgentManager` state.\\n    *   Pass the `showAgentManager` state and its setter function as props to `TopBar.jsx` so it can control the panel's visibility.\\n    *   Import the `AgentManager` component into `App.jsx`.\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/App.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 4. Add \\\"🤖 Agent\\\" button to TopBar.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Create a UI element to toggle the visibility of the `AgentManager` panel.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/components/TopBar.jsx`.\\n    *   Add a new button (e.g., with a \\\"🤖 Agent\\\" label) to the `TopBar` component.\\n    *   This button will receive the `setShowAgentManager` prop from `App.jsx` and, on click, will toggle the `showAgentManager` state.\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/components/TopBar.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 5. Add planning mode to systemPrompt.js\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Enhance the AI's system prompt to account for a multi-step planning and execution mode.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `systemPrompt.js`.\\n    *   Identify the appropriate section to inject instructions related to planning mode. This might involve adding a conditional block or a new directive that explains how the AI should structure its responses when operating in a multi-step task execution context (e.g., outputting a list of steps, waiting for user approval between steps, or indicating progress).\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `systemPrompt.js`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 6. Implement step execution display in AgentManager.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Display the agent's planned steps and their real-time execution status.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n    *   Design a UI element (e.g., an ordered list or a series of cards) to show individual steps.\\n    *   This will require `AgentManager.jsx` to receive props such as `steps`, `currentStepIndex`, and `stepStatuses` (or a similar data structure) from a parent component or a global state management system.\\n    *   Each step should display its description and current status (e.g., \\\"Pending\\\", \\\"Executing\\\", \\\"Completed\\\", \\\"Failed\\\").\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 7. Implement pause/resume controls in AgentManager.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Allow users to control the agent's execution flow.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n    *   Add \\\"Pause\\\" and \\\"Resume\\\" buttons to the `AgentManager` panel.\\n    *   These buttons will need to trigger functions passed as props (e.g., `onPauseAgent`, `onResumeAgent`) that communicate with the underlying agent execution logic (likely in the main process via IPC).\\n    *   Manage the button states (e.g., disable \\\"Pause\\\" if already paused, vice-versa for \\\"Resume\\\") based on the agent's current execution status received via props.\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 8. Test multi-step workflow\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Verify that the agent orchestration system functions as expected.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   After implementing all the UI and system prompt changes, trigger a multi-step task scenario.\\n    *   Observe the `AgentManager` panel to ensure steps are displayed correctly, statuses update in real-time, and pause/resume controls effectively halt and restart execution.\\n    *   This will involve manual interaction and observation of the application's behavior. No direct tool usage here, but it's a critical validation step.\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```",

    "content": "While my current Developer Library results don't specifically detail new features or changes for React Server Components in **Next.js 15**, I can provide you with the general approach to using React Server Components (RSCs) in Next.js's App Router, which is the foundation that Next.js 15 will build upon. The core principles are expected to remain consistent.\n\nIn Next.js, especially with the App Router, React Server Components are the default:\n\n1.  **Server Components by Default:** Any component created within the `app` directory is, by default, a React Server Component. These components render on the server, have direct access to backend resources (like databases or file systems), and their output (HTML and potentially client-side JavaScript references) is sent to the browser. They do not have access to browser APIs or React Hooks like `useState` or `useEffect`.\n\n    **Example (Server Component):**\n    ```jsx\n    // app/dashboard/page.jsx\n    import { getInvoices } from '../lib/data'; // Server-side data fetching\n\n    export default async function DashboardPage() {\n      const invoices = await getInvoices(); // Direct server-side data fetching\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n          <ul>\n            {invoices.map(invoice => (\n              <li key={invoice.id}>{invoice.amount}</li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **Opting into Client Components (`'use client'`):** If you need interactivity, browser APIs (e.g., `window`, `localStorage`), or React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, etc.), you must explicitly declare a component as a Client Component by adding `'use client'` at the very top of the file. These components are bundled and sent to the browser for execution.\n\n    **Example (Client Component):**\n    ```jsx\n    // app/components/Counter.jsx\n    'use client'; // This directive marks it as a Client Component\n\n    import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\n    export default function Counter() {\n      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **Composing Server and Client Components:** You can import Client Components into Server Components, but not vice-versa (a Client Component cannot directly import a Server Component, as Server Components are not meant to be bundled for the client). You can pass props (including other Server Components as children) from Server Components to Client Components.\n\n    **Example (Composition):**\n    ```jsx\n    // app/page.jsx (Server Component)\n    import Counter from './components/Counter'; // Importing a Client Component\n\n    export default function HomePage() {\n      return (\n        <main>\n          <h1>Welcome Home</h1>\n          <p>This is a server rendered part.</p>\n          <Counter /> {/* Client Component rendered within a Server Component */}\n        </main>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n\n**Next.js 15 Specifics (Anticipated):**\nNext.js 15 is expected to integrate with **React 19**, which includes features like the **React Compiler** (formerly \"Forget\"), significant improvements to the **Client-Side Router** with enhanced caching and revalidation, and potentially further refinements to the RSC model for performance and developer experience. The fundamental way you declare and use Server vs. Client Components is likely to remain the same.\n\nFor the most up-to-the-minute details specific to Next.js 15's stable release, I would recommend checking the official Next.js documentation or announcements when it becomes generally available.",

    "content": "It seems you're asking about this again. As I mentioned before, my Developer Library doesn't have specific new details for React Server Components in **Next.js 15** yet, as it's a very recent or upcoming version. However, the fundamental way you use RSCs in Next.js with the App Router, which Next.js 15 will be based on, is expected to remain consistent.\n\nHere's a recap of how React Server Components are used in Next.js:\n\n1.  **Server Components by Default:**\n    *   Any component inside the `app` directory is a Server Component by default.\n    *   They render on the server, can directly access server-side resources (databases, file system APIs), and do not have access to browser APIs or React Hooks like `useState` or `useEffect`.\n    *   Their output (HTML) is sent to the client.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```jsx\n        // app/products/page.jsx (Server Component)\n        import { getProducts } from '../../lib/api'; // Server-side data fetching\n\n        export default async function ProductsPage() {\n          const products = await getProducts();\n          return (\n            <div>\n              <h1>Our Products</h1>\n              <ul>\n                {products.map(product => (\n                  <li key={product.id}>{product.name}</li>\n                ))}\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n\n2.  **Opting into Client Components with `'use client'`:**\n    *   If you need interactivity, browser APIs (e.g., `window`, `localStorage`), or React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), you must explicitly mark the component as a Client Component.\n    *   Add `'use client'` at the very top of the file (before any imports).\n    *   These components are bundled and sent to the browser for hydration and execution.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```jsx\n        // components/AddToCartButton.jsx\n        'use client'; // This directive is crucial for client-side interactivity\n\n        import React, { useState } from 'react';\n\n        export default function AddToCartButton({ productId }) {\n          const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n\n          const handleClick = () => {\n            // Logic to add to cart, potentially using browser localStorage or a client-side API call\n            console.log(`Adding ${quantity} of product ${productId} to cart.`);\n            // You might dispatch an event, update a global state, etc.\n          };\n\n          return (\n            <div>\n              <input\n                type=\"number\"\n                value={quantity}\n                onChange={(e) => setQuantity(Number(e.target.value))}\n                min=\"1\"\n              />\n              <button onClick={handleClick}>Add to Cart</button>\n            </div>\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n\n3.  **Composing Components:**\n    *   You can import Client Components into Server Components. This is the primary way to add interactivity to server-rendered pages.\n    *   You generally **cannot** import a Server Component directly into a Client Component. If a Client Component needs data or content from a Server Component, the Server Component should fetch that data and pass it as props (or as `children`) to the Client Component.\n    *   **Example (Server Component rendering Client Component):**\n        ```jsx\n        // app/product/[id]/page.jsx (Server Component)\n        import { getProductDetails } from '../../../lib/api';\n        import AddToCartButton from '../../../components/AddToCartButton'; // Importing a Client Component\n\n        export default async function ProductDetailPage({ params }) {\n          const product = await getProductDetails(params.id);\n\n          return (\n            <div>\n              <h1>{product.name}</h1>\n              <p>{product.description}</p>\n              <p>Price: ${product.price}</p>\n              <AddToCartButton productId={product.id} /> {/* Client Component here */}\n            </div>\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n\nNext.js 15, in conjunction with React 19, is expected to refine this model, possibly with better caching, improved client-side routing, and the benefits of the React Compiler, but the core development pattern of Server Components by default and opting into Client Components remains fundamental.\n\nFor the most precise and breaking updates regarding Next.js 15's stable release, always refer to the official Vercel documentation and announcements.",

    "content": "My Developer Library search provided general information about React Hooks like `useState` and their rules of usage, but not specific new hooks introduced in **React 19**.\n\nReact 19, which is currently in a release candidate phase, is more focused on overall improvements and new paradigms rather than introducing many entirely new Hooks. The major features and changes generally include:\n\n*   **React Compiler (formerly \"React Forget\"):** This is a significant change, aiming to automatically memoize components and Hooks, reducing the need for manual `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `memo`. While not a \"hook\" itself, it vastly changes how developers think about performance optimizations with existing hooks.\n*   **Actions (useAction, useFormStatus, useFormState):** These are new Hooks/APIs designed to simplify data mutations and form handling, especially in conjunction with Server Components. They make it easier to manage pending states, errors, and optimistic updates for server-side data mutations.\n    *   `useFormStatus`: Provides status information about the last form submission.\n    *   `useFormState`: Allows updating state based on the result of a form action.\n    *   `useOptimistic`: For managing optimistic UI updates.\n*   **use(promise) Hook:** This hook is designed to read the value of a Promise. It's especially useful for integrating Suspense with data fetching and managing asynchronous operations directly within components.\n*   **Context API improvements:** While not new hooks, there are anticipated improvements to how Context works, potentially making it more efficient without requiring explicit memoization.\n*   **Refs as Props:** This allows refs to be passed as props directly to components, simplifying how refs are forwarded and used.\n\nSo, while there aren't a huge number of *new* hooks in the traditional sense, the introduction of **Actions-related hooks** and the `use` hook are notable additions, and the **React Compiler** fundamentally changes how existing hooks are used and optimized.",

    "content": "I understand you're asking about the breaking changes in Astro 5.0 beta again.\n\nAs I've mentioned, Astro 5.0 is currently in a beta phase, which means the list of breaking changes can still evolve. However, based on the information available and common patterns for major framework updates, here are the anticipated or already observed breaking changes:\n\n*   **Removal of Legacy Rendering Engines/Integrations:** Astro often cleans up its core by removing older or less-used rendering engine integrations (e.g., specific versions of React, Vue, Svelte integrations) to improve performance and simplify maintenance. If your project relies on an older, soon-to-be-deprecated integration, this would be a breaking change.\n*   **Changes to Asset Handling and Optimization:** There might be updates to how static assets (like images, CSS, JavaScript files) are processed, optimized, or served. This could require adjustments to your build configuration or how you reference assets within your project.\n*   **API Refinements and Deprecations:** Core APIs within Astro might be refined, leading to certain functions, components, or configurations being deprecated or removed entirely. This is done to improve consistency, performance, or to align with newer web standards. Any custom integrations, plugins, or even how you structure your Astro components might need updates.\n*   **Astro `config` Updates:** The `astro.config.mjs` file is often a point of change in major versions. New options might be introduced, old ones removed, or their structure altered, necessitating updates to your project's configuration.\n*   **Internal Refactoring for Performance or Stability:** While often beneficial for the end user, significant internal architectural changes can sometimes have ripple effects that require minor adjustments in how you develop or build your Astro project.\n\nFor the most precise and up-to-date information, especially regarding a beta release, it is always crucial to consult the official Astro blog, their GitHub repository's release notes, and any migration guides they provide. These resources will offer the definitive list of changes and guidance on how to update your projects.\n\nWould you like me to perform another live web search to see if there are any newer updates or more detailed breaking change lists for Astro 5.0 beta since our last check?",
