Create AgentManager.jsx panel\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Create the foundational React component for the Agent Manager panel.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   Create a new functional React component file `AgentManager.jsx` in `src/renderer/components/`.\\n    *   Include a basic `div` structure that will eventually hold the step execution display, controls, and status.\\n    *   Import React and define a default functional component.\\n*   **Tools:** `writeFile`\\n\\n## 2. Create agentmanager.css styles\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Provide initial styling for the `AgentManager` panel.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   Create a new CSS file `agentmanager.css` in `src/renderer/styles/`.\\n    *   Add basic styles for the main container and placeholder elements within the `AgentManager` component to ensure it's visually distinct when rendered.\\n*   **Tools:** `writeFile`\\n\\n## 3. Add panel state to App.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Integrate the `AgentManager` panel into the main application, controlled by its own state.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/App.jsx`.\\n    *   Add a new state variable, e.g., `showAgentManager`, using the `useState` hook to manage the visibility of the panel.\\n    *   Conditionally render the `AgentManager` component within `App.jsx` based on the `showAgentManager` state.\\n    *   Pass the `showAgentManager` state and its setter function as props to `TopBar.jsx` so it can control the panel's visibility.\\n    *   Import the `AgentManager` component into `App.jsx`.\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/App.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 4. Add \\\"🤖 Agent\\\" button to TopBar.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Create a UI element to toggle the visibility of the `AgentManager` panel.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/components/TopBar.jsx`.\\n    *   Add a new button (e.g., with a \\\"🤖 Agent\\\" label) to the `TopBar` component.\\n    *   This button will receive the `setShowAgentManager` prop from `App.jsx` and, on click, will toggle the `showAgentManager` state.\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/components/TopBar.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 5. Add planning mode to systemPrompt.js\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Enhance the AI's system prompt to account for a multi-step planning and execution mode.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `systemPrompt.js`.\\n    *   Identify the appropriate section to inject instructions related to planning mode. This might involve adding a conditional block or a new directive that explains how the AI should structure its responses when operating in a multi-step task execution context (e.g., outputting a list of steps, waiting for user approval between steps, or indicating progress).\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `systemPrompt.js`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 6. Implement step execution display in AgentManager.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Display the agent's planned steps and their real-time execution status.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n    *   Design a UI element (e.g., an ordered list or a series of cards) to show individual steps.\\n    *   This will require `AgentManager.jsx` to receive props such as `steps`, `currentStepIndex`, and `stepStatuses` (or a similar data structure) from a parent component or a global state management system.\\n    *   Each step should display its description and current status (e.g., \\\"Pending\\\", \\\"Executing\\\", \\\"Completed\\\", \\\"Failed\\\").\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 7. Implement pause/resume controls in AgentManager.jsx\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Allow users to control the agent's execution flow.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   `readFile` the content of `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n    *   Add \\\"Pause\\\" and \\\"Resume\\\" buttons to the `AgentManager` panel.\\n    *   These buttons will need to trigger functions passed as props (e.g., `onPauseAgent`, `onResumeAgent`) that communicate with the underlying agent execution logic (likely in the main process via IPC).\\n    *   Manage the button states (e.g., disable \\\"Pause\\\" if already paused, vice-versa for \\\"Resume\\\") based on the agent's current execution status received via props.\\n    *   `writeFile` the modified content back to `src/renderer/components/AgentManager.jsx`.\\n*   **Tools:** `readFile`, `writeFile`\\n\\n## 8. Test multi-step workflow\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Verify that the agent orchestration system functions as expected.\\n*   **Approach:**\\n    *   After implementing all the UI and system prompt changes, trigger a multi-step task scenario.\\n    *   Observe the `AgentManager` panel to ensure steps are displayed correctly, statuses update in real-time, and pause/resume controls effectively halt and restart execution.\\n    *   This will involve manual interaction and observation of the application's behavior. No direct tool usage here, but it's a critical validation step.\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```",
